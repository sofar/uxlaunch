  Installation
  ============

Installing uxlaunch and making it operational should only require 3 steps:

1) running `./configure; make; make install` in this source directory
2) editing the configuration file
3) configuring your system to start uxlaunch automatically

Step 1 should be trivial.

Step 2, editing the configuration file. This step is optional for single-
user systems where there is only one user account with a /home/$USER folder.
In case you need a different desktop than the programmed default started, you
can use this configuration file to specify a different default session. The
configuration file is normally installed as /etc/sysconfig/uxlaunch.

Step 3, configuring your system to start uxlaunch at boot time, should be
accomplished by using the provided systemd service file. You may have to
systemctl enable uxlaunch.service and/or systemctl start uxlaunch.service.
Or, in case of sysvinit, one cat insert the following line in /etc/inittab:

	x:5:respawn:/usr/sbin/uxlaunch

If your system uses upstart or another non-sysvinit style startup system,
you may need to consult the manual of that on how to achieve this.
